## Overview
A small library which validates and sets your git hooks

## Requirements
* A folder with all your git hooks, ready to be linked from other git repositories
* Node 6 (I recommend installing the node version manager - nvm: https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

## Installation

```shell
install the hooky.workflow file"
```

## Usage
### Quick start
* Download default workflow from here: https://github.com/ashafir20/hooky/blob/master/Hooky.alfredworkflow?raw=true
* Import it to Alfred
* Type `hookyconfig` in alfred and set your configuration settings
* Type `hooky` to get a list of repositories and their git hooks status
* Select a repo from the list and your git hooks will be hooked together. ;]
